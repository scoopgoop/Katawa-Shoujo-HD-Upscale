# Katawa Shoujo HD Upscale
The game has been kept as true-to-original as possible while upscaling to a 1080p resolution.
All UI elements, text, video, sprites, and backgrounds are now up 1.8x from 600p to 1080p.
All routes and menus have been checked and ran through for any bugs or dialogue errors.

Known bugs: 
 - Auto mode is broken.
 - Good ending credit videos are slightly over-saturated.
 - Checkbox wipe animation was cut, will be re-implemented if a fix is found.
 
Outside of these, please let me know if any bugs, no matter how minor, are discovered. I want to make this a direct resolution upgrade with no alterations to the original, and fixing any bugs will allow me to do so.
